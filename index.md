## CS Essentials

CS Essentials is a series of **weekly online summer lectures** taught by your fellow OSU students. We'll talk about concepts, resources, and tools to help you succeed in your CS education, with a heavy focus on topics you need to know but that aren't covered super well in-class -- things like using **the OSU servers** (basic shell commands, ssh & flip), **text editors** (vim, VS Code), **version control** (git, GitHub), **debugging tools** (gdb, valgrind), and more. Think similar to [MIT's Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu), but adapted for OSU students.

### Who's it for?

This course is aimed primarily at incoming sophomores at Oregon State University. But you don't have to be a sophomore or an OSU student to join -- there's something in here for everyone to benefit from.

### Who are you?

We're a bunch of OSU students, mostly juniors and seniors, who want to help our peers by sharing some of the things we've learned. This project is a collaboration between the [OSU Linux Users Group](https://lug.oregonstate.edu/), [OSU ACM](http://acm.oregonstate.edu/), and the Church of Evan student-run community Discord server.

### I'm interested, how do I join?

Fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/jZne3San1mzjJQCG6)! You'll get a link to the Discord server, and we'll send you an email with more information as we get closer to the summer.

If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or want to get involved, head over to the #cs-essentials channel on Discord, or email us at [info@cs-essentials.com](mailto:info@cs-essentials.com).
