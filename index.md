## CS Essentials

![](http://textfiles.com/underconstruction/mamagnolia_acresunderconstruction.gif)

CS Essentials is a series of (TODO: weekly?) online lectures taught by your fellow OSU students over the summer. We'll talk about tips, tricks, and tools to help you succeed in your CS education, with a heavy focus on **things you're expected to know but OSU doesn't teach** -- like the shell, ssh & flip, vim, git, gdb, valgrind, and more. Think similar to [MIT's Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu), but for OSU students.

### Who's it for?

This course is aimed primarily at incoming sophomores at Oregon State University. But you don't have to be a sophomore or an OSU student to join -- there's something in here for everyone to benefit from.

### Who are you?

We're a bunch of OSU students, mostly juniors and seniors, who want to help our peers by sharing some of the things we've learned. This project is a collaboration between the [OSU Linux Users Group](https://lug.oregonstate.edu/), [OSU Security Club](https://www.osusec.org/), [OSU ACM](http://acm.oregonstate.edu/), and the Church of Evan student-run community Discord server.

### I'm interested, how do I join?

That's a really good question.
